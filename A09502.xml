            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For (as the iudgement is of al holy and gooſtly wryters) there are thre ſpecial means to optain of almighty god the grace of perfectyon. That is to ſay.

Theſe and other bytternes and melancoly of harte, thou muſt diſtroy and conſume in ſwetnes of the loue of god that thou mayſt loue thy very enimeis and perſecutours wyth as ful affection of thy harte as though they were thy mooſt dere frendes, as in very dede they be, for they do bryng &amp; promote the vnto greate merytes. ¶The eyght is the mortifycacion of al a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vnto vayne glorye and lykynge of thy ſelfe, honoure, &amp; to all pride of thy ſelfe in thy wordes and dedes, of thy graces and gyftes. To this thou ſhalte come, by clere

they do not amend faythfully their fautes, whoſe pryckinges and remorſe troubleth them, nether can they haue ful confydence in god.

                  <p>¶The other mekenes, is, the mekenes of the perfecte and the mekenes whiche loue alone by her ſelfe dothe worke, whome the ſoule fealeth in her ſelfe by gooſtly ſyghte and knowlege of Ieſu. For whom the holy gooſt doth lyghten the reaſon in the ſyght of Ieſu Chryſt, to conſider clearly the holy humylytie, &amp; charitie of his bleſſyd manhed &amp; to tayſt both of them by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodnes of hys diuinitie, and by &amp; by the ſoule perceauyth ſo great loue &amp; ioy, in that ſight (the whiche is very true holy and delectable) that it for gettith her ſelfe, and al thinges els, and leanith &amp; cleuith holy to her mooſt ſwetteſt ſpowſe and Lorde Ieſu Chryſt, by reaſon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe is caryed or borne, with al her whole loue, to conſyder and to beholde him. She for that tyme, conſiderith not her ſynnes done in tymes paſt, nor her vnworthynes, but eſtemyth her ſelfe with all her ſynnes and good workes that euer ſhe did as right nought, and nothing, as though ther were nothing in al the world but only her Lorde Ieſu Cryſt.

Thus in the pouertie of ſpirite loue to feale thi ſelfe to be nought or nothyng, that thou maiſt aſcrybe al thy goodnes only vnto thy Lord Ieſu Chryſt, that thy ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (as the prophet ſaith) may be as a thing of nought before him not, eſte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myng thy ſelfe here after to be any thynge ſyth thou arte nothing.

and plainly fealiſt thy ſelfe to be in God then muſt thou learne to abide &amp; remayne in hym. The which is the moſt bleſſid trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure in this world, or in this lyfe.
